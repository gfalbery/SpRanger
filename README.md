# SpRanger

## Very in development, mostly useless at this point

Tools for deriving and manipulating IUCN species ranges and creating overlap matrices.

Get the ranges from here: 

Change them to rasters with this:

Get species overlaps with `PairsWisely`, which takes a rasterbrick with one layer per species and returns an overlap matrix where each row and column is a species and each cell is a proportion of cells that both species inhabit.
